## threats

The "threat model" of this project is not purely induvidual. The threat it
adresses is the tracking industry. So not all measures in this project are
intended to protect you from all tracking, but they are intended to protect you
from common commercial tracking.

We want to threaten trarcking on a large scale, we want to be the threat model
of the tracking industry.
